The linux-configs collection
============================

The linux-configs Collection is a set of kernel configuration files for
the Linux kernel. This collection tracks the stable and Long-Term-Support
(LTS) releases in the Linux Kernel Archives.

The collection contains files that have been preconfigured in order to be
used, with different architectures and with certain hardware requirements,
when a new Linux kernel is to be built.

How to use
==========

This collection is designed to work automatically with the BANDIT toolkit
and the phyglos catalog. In this case everything is handled by the BANDIT;
only the desired kernel version has to be selected in the phyglos-kernel
bundle configuration.

However, the included .config files in this collection can be used as independent
Kconfig files when manually building a new Linux kernel. In order to use these
files manually just download the wanted file from the GitHub repository or
download and uncompress the package from the FTP site.

Status
======

The linux-config collection is in DEVELOPMENT status. This means that it is
unstable and can still suffer big changes. However, it is already in regular
use in the phyglos-kernel bundle of the phyglos catalog for the phy GNU/Linux
Operating System.
